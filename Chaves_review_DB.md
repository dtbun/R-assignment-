Review for Daniel Bun

Hello Daniel, I have some comments on your R assignment:

1. You found a nice way to show your code, I like the general format and the way you can just click on run and everything works smoothly.
2. I read your command lines and found them very clean and easy to understand. You kept it simple and with no extra commands that could confuse the reader, concise.
3. Interesting to learn other ways to make it more easy
4. I would suggest to add a short description of the project before the code chunk, so people that are not from the class can understand what you are trying to do and what kind of data they are working with.
5. From the  visualization part, I see that the plots for amount of homozygous and amount of heterozygous are different. I think you should keep the figures with the same format, unless you want to show some other data then add a new figure.
6. There are some extra chunks at the end of your main chunk, are they suposed to be there?

Thank you for sharing your assignment!

Manuela Chaves
